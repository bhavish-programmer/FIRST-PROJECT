class: Specifies one or more class names for an element (used in CSS and JavaScript).

html
<div class="container">
    This is a container.
</div>

id: Specifies a unique id for an element (used in CSS and JavaScript).

html
<h1 id="main-title">Welcome to My Website</h1>
src: Specifies the source file for an image or a script.

html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful scenery">
<script src="script.js"></script>
href: Specifies the URL of a link.

html

alt: Provides alternative text for an image, useful for accessibility.

style: Adds inline CSS to an element.

html
<p style="color: blue;">This text is blue.</p>
title: Adds a tooltip text that appears when the mouse hovers over the element.

Attributes can be very powerful when used effectively, as they help define the behavior and appearance of HTML elements in your web page.
