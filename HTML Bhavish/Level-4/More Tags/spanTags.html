The `<span>` tag in HTML is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text or a part of a document. It doesn't inherently represent anything and doesn't have any default formatting, but it can be useful when you want to apply styles or scripts to a portion of text without disrupting the flow of the content.

    Here's a basic example of how the `<span>` tag might be used:
    
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <style>
            .highlight {
                background-color: yellow;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is a <span class="highlight">highlighted</span> text within a paragraph.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    
    In this example, the `<span>` tag is used to highlight a part of the text within a paragraph by applying a CSS class named `highlight`. This way, you can style only the specific text within the `<span>` tag without affecting the rest of the paragraph. The `<span>` tag is very flexible and is commonly used for applying styles or scripting actions to small parts of the content.
