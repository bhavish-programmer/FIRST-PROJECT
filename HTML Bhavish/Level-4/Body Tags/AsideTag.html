The <aside> tag in HTML is used to define content that is tangentially related to the content around it. This is typically used for sidebars, pull quotes, and other elements that are not the main content but are still related to the main content of the page. The <aside> content is often presented as a sidebar or a callout box.

    Here is an example of how the <aside> tag might be used:
    
    html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Article with Aside</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <main>
            <article>
                <h1>Understanding the Universe</h1>
                <p>The universe is vast and filled with wonders...</p>
            </article>
            
            <aside>
                <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
                <p>Did you know? The Milky Way galaxy is estimated to contain between 100 and 400 billion stars!</p>
            </aside>
        </main>
    </body>
    </html>
    In this example, the <aside> contains a fun fact that is related to the main content of the article but is not part of the main flow of the text. The browser typically styles the <aside> content differently to make it stand out from the main content.
