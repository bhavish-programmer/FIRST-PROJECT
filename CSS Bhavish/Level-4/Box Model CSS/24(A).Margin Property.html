<!-- The margin property in CSS is used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders. This property helps in positioning elements and controlling the space between them. You can set margins for all four sides of an element (top, right, bottom, and left) either individually or simultaneously.

Syntax:-
You can specify margins in several ways:

All sides:
  css:
margin: 20px;
This sets 20 pixels of margin on all four sides.

Individual sides:

  css:
margin-top: 10px;
margin-right: 15px;
margin-bottom: 20px;
margin-left: 25px;
Shorthand for all sides:

  css:
margin: 10px 15px 20px 25px;
This sets the margins in the following order: top, right, bottom, and left.

Shorthand for vertical and horizontal margins:

css:
margin: 10px 20px;
This sets 10 pixels of margin on the top and bottom, and 20 pixels on the left and right.

Auto margins:

css
margin: 0 auto;
This horizontally centers the element within its container (commonly used with fixed-width elements). -->
