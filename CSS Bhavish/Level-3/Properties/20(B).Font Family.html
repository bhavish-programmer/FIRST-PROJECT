<!-- In CSS, the font-family property is used to specify the font for an HTML element. This property can list multiple fonts, separated by commas, to provide fallbacks in case the preferred font is not available. Here's how you can use the font-family property:

css
body {
    font-family: "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif;
}

h1 {
    font-family: "Georgia", serif;
}
In this example:

The body element uses Arial as the primary font, with Helvetica as the first fallback and any available sans-serif font as the second fallback.

The h1 element uses Georgia as the primary font and any available serif font as the fallback.

Generic Font Families
CSS recognizes several generic font families that can be used as fallbacks:

serif: Fonts with small lines at the ends of characters, like Times New Roman.

sans-serif: Fonts without those lines, like Arial.

monospace: Fonts where each character takes up the same amount of space, like Courier.

cursive: Fonts that mimic handwriting, like Comic Sans MS.

fantasy: Decorative fonts that are more playful, like Impact.

Custom Fonts
You can also use custom fonts in your web page by linking to a font file or using a service like Google Fonts. Hereâ€™s an example of using a custom font from Google Fonts:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html> -->
<head>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph with the Roboto font.</p>
</body>
</html>
In this example, the Roboto font is imported from Google Fonts and applied to the body element.
