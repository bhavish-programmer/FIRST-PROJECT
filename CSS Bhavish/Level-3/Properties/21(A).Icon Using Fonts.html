<!-- Using icon fonts in CSS is a powerful way to add icons to your web pages. Popular icon font libraries like Font Awesome or Google's Material Icons make it easy to include a wide range of icons in your projects. Here's an example of how to use Font Awesome to add icons to your HTML and style them with CSS.

Step-by-Step Example with Font Awesome:
Include Font Awesome in your HTML:

You can include Font Awesome in your project by adding the following <link> tag to the <head> section of your HTML file: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Icon Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta3/css/all.min.css">
    <style>
        .icon {
            font-size: 24px;
            color: #333;
            margin-right: 10px;
        }

        .icon-large {
            font-size: 48px;
            color: #007bff;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1><i class="fas fa-home icon"></i> Home</h1>
    <p><i class="fas fa-envelope icon-large"></i> Contact Us</p>
</body>
</html>


<!-- 
Using Icons in Your HTML:

In the example above:

The <link> tag includes the Font Awesome library from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

The <i> tags with class names fas fa-home and fas fa-envelope represent the home and envelope icons, respectively.

Additional CSS classes (icon and icon-large) are used to style the icons.

Styling Icons with CSS:

The CSS inside the <style> tag styles the icons:

The .icon class sets the font size and color for the icons.

The .icon-large class sets a larger font size and a different color for the icons. -->
