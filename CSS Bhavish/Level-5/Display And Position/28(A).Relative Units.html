<!-- Relative units in CSS are incredibly handy, especially when you want your design to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes. Here are some commonly used relative units:

1. **em**: This unit is relative to the font size of the element itself. For example, if the font size of the element is 16px, then 1em is 16px.

2. **rem**: This unit is relative to the font size of the root element (usually the `<html>` element). If the root font size is 16px, 1rem equals 16px regardless of the font size of the element.

3. **% (Percentage)**: This unit is often used for width and height. It is relative to the parent element's dimensions. For example, if an element has a width of 50%, it will take up half the width of its parent.

4. **vw (Viewport Width)**: This unit is based on the width of the viewport. 1vw equals 1% of the viewport's width.

5. **vh (Viewport Height)**: Similar to vw, but based on the height of the viewport. 1vh equals 1% of the viewport's height.

6. **vmin and vmax**: These units are relative to the smaller or larger dimension of the viewport, respectively. `vmin` is based on the smaller value between the viewport's width and height, and `vmax` is based on the larger value.

Here's a brief example to show how these units can be used:
css:
/* Using em */
h1 {
    font-size: 2em; /* 2 times the font size of the element */
}

/* Using rem */
p {
    font-size: 1.5rem; /* 1.5 times the root element's font size */
}

/* Using percentage */
.container {
    width: 80%; /* 80% of the parent element's width */
}

/* Using viewport units */
.header {
    height: 10vh; /* 10% of the viewport height */
    width: 100vw; /* 100% of the viewport width */
}


Utilizing these relative units will help your designs remain flexible and look good on different devices. If there's more specific information you need or examples, feel free to ask! -->
