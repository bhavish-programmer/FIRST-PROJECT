Explanation:
Viewport Units (vh and vw): The header's height is set to 20vh, meaning it will take up 20% of the viewport's height, ensuring it adjusts with the screen size. The padding-top is set to 5vh for additional spacing.

em Units: The h1 element inside the header uses 2em for its font size. If the header's font size is 16px (by default), the h1's font size will be 32px (2 x 16px).

rem Units: The paragraph's font size and other properties like line-height, padding, and border-radius are set using rem units. These are based on the root element's font size, making the design consistent throughout.

Percentage: The containerâ€™s width is set to 80% of its parent element, with margin auto for centering.

This approach helps create a responsive layout that adjusts well across various screen sizes.
