Semantic Tags:

1) Meaningful: Describe content.
2) SEO: Good for search engines.
3) Accessibility: Useful for screen readers.
4) Exmaples: <header></header>, <footer></footer>,
<article></article>, <section></section>, <nav></nav>. 


Non-semantic Tag: 

1) Generic: No specific meaning.
2) For Styling: Used for Layout.
3) No SEO: Not SEO-friently. 
4) Example: <div></div>,<b></b>


 Each semantic tag provides a meaningful context to the content it encloses. Here’s a deeper look at some of the most commonly used ones:

1. **`<header>`**:
   - Represents the introductory content for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element.
   - Typically contains heading elements, introductory content, or navigational links.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <header>
       <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
       <nav>
         <ul>
           <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
           <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
           <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
         </ul>
       </nav>
     </header>
     ```

2. **`<nav>`**:
   - Defines a set of navigation links.
   - Used to group together links to other pages or sections within the same page.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <nav>
       <ul>
         <li><a href="#section1">Section 1</a></li>
         <li><a href="#section2">Section 2</a></li>
       </ul>
     </nav>
     

3. **`<article>`**:
   - Represents a self-contained, independent piece of content.
   - Could be a blog post, news article, or forum post.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <article>
       <h2>Understanding Semantic Tags</h2>
       <p>Semantic tags help provide meaning to your HTML code...</p>
     </article>
     

4. **`<section>`**:
   - Defines a section within a document.
   - Typically, each section would have its own heading.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <section>
       <h2>Introduction</h2>
       <p>This section introduces the topic...</p>
     </section>
     

5. **`<aside>`**:
   - Contains content that is tangentially related to the content around it.
   - Often used for sidebars or pull quotes.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <aside>
       <h2>Related Information</h2>
       <p>This is some related information...</p>
     </aside>
     

6. **`<footer>`**:
   - Represents the footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element.
   - Typically contains information about the author, copyright, or links to related documents.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <footer>
       <p>© 2024 My Website</p>
       <p><a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a></p>
     </footer>
     

7. **`<main>`**:
   - Denotes the main content of the document.
   - There should be only one `<main>` element per document.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <main>
       <h1>Welcome to Our Website</h1>
       <p>Here you'll find a variety of resources...</p>
     </main>
     

8. **`<figure>`**:
   - Represents self-contained content, often with a caption.
   - Used for images, diagrams, or code listings.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <figure>
       <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
       <figcaption>Caption for the image</figcaption>
     </figure>
     

<!-- 9. **`<figcaption>`**:
   - Provides a caption for the `<figure>` element.
   - Example (within the `<figure>` example above).

These tags make your HTML more readable and accessible, providing context and meaning to the content they enclose. They also help search engines and assistive technologies understand the structure and purpose of your content, improving SEO and accessibility.
