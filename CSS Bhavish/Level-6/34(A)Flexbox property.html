<!-- 
The flex property in CSS is a powerful tool for creating flexible and responsive layouts. Here's a brief summary of how it automatically adjusts height and width between containers:

The flex property is a shorthand for setting three other properties: flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis. When you apply display: flex to a container, it enables the container's children (flex items) to adjust their size dynamically.

flex-grow determines how much a flex item will grow relative to the other items in the container when there is extra space.

flex-shrink specifies how a flex item will shrink relative to the other items in the container when there is not enough space.

flex-basis defines the initial size of a flex item before any growing or shrinking occurs.

By combining these properties, you can create layouts where the elements adjust their dimensions automatically to fit the available space. This is especially useful for responsive design, where you want your layout to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.

Here's a quick example in code:

css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.item {
  flex: 1; /* Equivalent to flex: 1 1 0; */
}
In this example, all the flex items within the .container will grow and shrink equally, distributing space evenly among themselves. -->
