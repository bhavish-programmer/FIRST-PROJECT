<!-- Transitions in CSS allow you to change property values smoothly (over a given duration) when they change. Let's create a simple HTML example to demonstrate how transitions work.

### HTML (index.html) -->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>CSS Transitions</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="box">Hover over me</div>
</body>
</html>


<!-- ### Explanation

- **HTML**: The HTML file contains a single `div` element with the class `box`.
- **CSS**: 
  - The `.box` class defines a square box with a background color of light blue. 
  - The `transition` property is used to define the transition effect. It specifies that both the `background-color` and `transform` properties should transition over 0.5 seconds.
  - The `.box:hover` class changes the `background-color` to light coral and scales the box up by 20% when it is hovered over.

This simple example demonstrates how to use CSS transitions to smoothly animate changes in property values. You can add more properties and experiment with different transition durations and easing functions to create more complex animations.
