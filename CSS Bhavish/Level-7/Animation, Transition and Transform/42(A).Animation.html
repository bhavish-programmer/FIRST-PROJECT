<!-- Sure! Let's dive deeper into CSS animations with a detailed practical example. We'll create a more complex animation that involves multiple properties, keyframes, and timing functions.

### Key Concepts of CSS Animation

1. **@keyframes**: Defines the animation's keyframes.
2. **animation-name**: The name of the animation.
3. **animation-duration**: How long the animation lasts.
4. **animation-timing-function**: The speed curve of the animation (e.g., linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out).
5. **animation-delay**: Delay before the animation starts.
6. **animation-iteration-count**: How many times the animation should run (e.g., infinite).
7. **animation-direction**: Whether the animation should play in reverse on alternate cycles (e.g., normal, reverse, alternate, alternate-reverse).
8. **animation-fill-mode**: Specifies how a CSS animation applies styles to its target before and after its execution (e.g., none, forwards, backwards, both).

### Practical Example

In this example, we'll create a bouncing ball animation with a shadow effect.

### HTML (index.html) -->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>CSS Bouncing Ball Animation</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="ball"></div>
</body>
</html>

<!-- 
### CSS (styles.css)

```css

```

### Explanation

- **HTML**: Contains a single `div` element with the class `ball`.
- **CSS**:
  - The `.ball` class styles the ball element to be a 50x50 pixel circle with a light coral background color.
  - The `animation` property on the `.ball` class specifies the animation name (`bounce`), duration (2 seconds), timing function (`ease-in-out`), and iteration count (`infinite`).
  - `@keyframes bounce`: Defines the keyframes for the bounce animation.
    - `0%` and `100%`: The ball is at its initial position (translated by 0 on the Y-axis) with a shadow to give a sense of depth.
    - `50%`: The ball is translated upward by -200px, and the shadow is adjusted to give the illusion of height.

### Additional Properties and Effects

You can enhance the animation by adding more properties and effects. For instance, changing colors, scaling, or rotating the ball during the animation.

#### Example with Color Change and Scaling

```css
@keyframes bounce {
  0%, 100% {
    transform: translateY(0) scale(1);
    background-color: lightcoral;
    box-shadow: 0 20px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  }
  50% {
    transform: translateY(-200px) scale(1.2);
    background-color: lightblue;
    box-shadow: 0 50px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  }
}
```

In this enhanced version:
- The ball scales up slightly and changes color at the peak of its bounce.

CSS animations can create smooth, visually appealing effects that enhance user experience. If you have any specific animations in mind or need more detailed examples, feel free to let me know! -->
